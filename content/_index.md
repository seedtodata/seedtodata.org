# Building the Future of Farming: Introducing SeedToData

**SeedToData** is a bold new initiative to transform Indian agriculture through an open, centralized data platform. Inspired by collaborative models like OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia, SeedToData will collect and share vital agricultural data â€” from crop types and pest outbreaks to irrigation methods and weather patterns â€” all without compromising farmer privacy.

The goal? To empower farmers, researchers, and innovators with the data they need to improve harvests, fight crop diseases, and make smarter, tech-driven decisions.

We're building a community of technologists, agricultural experts, policy thinkers, and grassroots organizers to bring this vision to life. If you're passionate about rural development, open data, or agri-tech, join us and help shape the future of farming in India.
